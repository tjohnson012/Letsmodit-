Beginning:
Modding a Nintendo Switch is a simple process as long as you take this guides example step by step. 

Before you may begin, there are two important steps.

First, go to the website, https://ismyswitchpatched.com/ this will allow for you to check if your nintendo switch is ready to be modded or via this method or if it is not.Enter your serial number found on the bottom of your nintendo switch or from the HOME Menu, select System Settings. Scroll down the menu on the left-hand side and select System, followed by Serial Information. The system serial number will be displayed at the top of the list. Nintendo Switchs purchased in 2017-2018 are very likely to be moddable while later models are not.  

The website can range from a green yes, a red no, or even a yellow maybe. If you get a maybe, hope is not lost as you just might be able to mod it but not for sure all you can do is try. But if you get a no, you're only way of modding your switch is either buying a nintendo switch with the proper serial number or hunting down someone to put in a mod chip, which is a risk in itself as they could put the mods into your switch improperly and end up frying your switch or the mods installed just don't work as you would want them to.

If you got a yes or a maybe, your next step is to purchase this item here: https://www.amazon.com/RGEEK-Nintendo-Circuit-Archive-Simulator/dp/B07Q6YHRBM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?hvadid=283737424986&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9015712&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=10783953693944332292&hvtargid=kwd-467797138521&hydadcr=6114_9326509&keywords=rcm+jig&qid=1707751344&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1

This is an RCM (Recovery mode) jig. As its name proclaims, its a piece that you insert into the right railing of your nintendo switch which allows for the a vulnerability to be attacked within the nintendo switch putting the switch into a boot state called recovery mode, which allows for the system to be manipulated. It costs about $8 and one of the most essential pieces. The jig makes contact with the 1 pin closest to the front of your switch and the 10 pin further to the back of the switch. If you miss these pins, your switch WILL be fried. Rendered useless. If you think you are up for the task or can not afford the purchase for this jig, their are several ways to make your own, but that is at your own risk.

You're gonna need a micro sd card that's bigger than 64 gigs. In my honest opinion, get a bigger sd card as you will really get frustrated with a small sd card and end up buying a bigger one anyway, probably about 256gb. Make sure you have a micro sd card reader or a computer that has the ability to read sd cards in the adapter.
